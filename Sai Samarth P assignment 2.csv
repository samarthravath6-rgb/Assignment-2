In addition to same employees are supported with facilities like internet reimbursement so that there is no impact for employees

2. After completion of apprentice training of 1 year I contnue as a DET on 2nd year.
Company HR directly told before joining that there will be no further extension in job neither your excellent performance can give you confirmation in job. Never accept permanent job...
Job Security: After completion 2 years of training, when company was started during covid 19 period company requested to  all DET for joining again as a NEEM trainee.
Everyone was afraid of deadly virus but still some of us including me joined company as company's officers who called us given a commitment of atleast 1 year job cause they have our need  in pandemic situation.
We got joining and punching card with 6 month validity
But company's management informed via email that NEEM trainee will be removed and DET will be replaced them.
We request to management to extend just for 6 months from the date of our joining but they denied and put a 2 options in front of us.
Either do job until company keep you, dont rely on punching card expiry date
Or go to home, give resign
We decided about our future and given resign cause company could throw us anytime when their need is completed.
Cant believe in Management Policies that can be change anytime.
Officers are so unprofessional and use abusive language while in official meeting in front of all trainees also.
Wages: There is no issue about salary...Read More","There is no hope for permanent job in this company.
Cant expect promotion even after 100% best performance. (only for DET and NEEM trainee)
Management can change their decisions anyime
Company has removed all DET's which could not came on job due to lockdown.
Company's officers will force you to continue even after 8 hours and if you denied you will be warned or you will have threat to resign from job.
DET dont get over time for their extra working they get C off instead of overtime. While NEEM get double over time for 8 hours job.
DET and NEEM trainee cant avail free bus facility. Also when if they are ready to.pay for bus. Bus facility is only available to permanent employees.
You have to work extra for free in the name of training but there will be no training in extra working hours, you will have to work in company even after 8 hours cause officers force you to do so....Read More"
